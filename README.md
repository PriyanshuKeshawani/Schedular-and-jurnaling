# 🧠 Nexus AI Scheduler  
*A deeply thought-out AI-powered task & productivity system*

🔗 **Live App:** https://fainally-didi-it.vercel.app

## 🧩 Why I Built This

Most task and productivity apps struggle with **future task management**.

They often:
- Mix future tasks with today’s tasks  
- Break state when timelines are edited  
- Lose context when AI generates tasks  
- Accidentally overwrite tasks  

I built **Nexus AI Scheduler** to solve one core problem:

> **How can an AI reliably manage today’s tasks and future tasks without breaking UI state, timelines, or user intent?**

This project focuses on **state isolation**, **predictable scheduling**, and **safe AI task generation**.  
It is built as a real system, not a demo.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🤖 AI-Generated Task Handling
- Paste unstructured schedules (paragraphs, routines, lists)
- AI converts them into structured, time-based tasks
- Tasks are validated before storage
- Prevents duplicate or malformed tasks  

**Why this matters:** AI output is unpredictable. This system contains and controls AI behavior.

---

### 📅 Future Task Isolation (Key Feature)
Future tasks:
- Are stored separately
- Do not depend on today’s task state
- Automatically appear when date & time conditions are met
- Are immune to edits made to current-day tasks  

This prevents timeline corruption, accidental overwrites, and UI inconsistencies.

---

### ⏱️ Timeline-Based Planner
- Tasks visualized in time blocks
- Dynamic movement from future → present
- Clear separation between Today, Upcoming, and History

---

### 📊 Analytics & History
- Completed tasks are archived
- Productivity patterns become visible
- Encourages reflection, not task overload

---

### 📓 Journal Integration
- Daily notes and productivity logs
- Designed to support focus, not distraction

---

### 🔐 Authentication & Data Safety
- Secure authentication flow
- Isolated user data
- No task leakage between sessions

---

## 🧠 Architecture Decisions

### State Isolation Strategy
- Current tasks and future tasks never share state
- UI updates are scoped to active timelines
- Prevents cascading re-renders

### Supabase Usage
Tasks are stored with:
- Date
- Time
- Status
- Source (AI / Manual)

Queries are time-aware, and future tasks are fetched conditionally.

### Why Not Firestore
Predictable relational behavior and clearer timeline control were required. Supabase fit this better.
